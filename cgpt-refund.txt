Refund Policy

At [Your Ecommerce Website], we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason you are not satisfied, we offer a hassle-free return and refund policy.

Returns

To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

To initiate a return, please email us at [insert email address] within [insert number] days of receiving your purchase. We'll provide you with a return authorization number and a shipping label. Please pack the item securely in the original product packaging, and include all paperwork, parts, and accessories.

You are responsible for paying the shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

Refunds

Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item.

If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.

Exchanges

If you would like to exchange your item for a different size or color, please email us at [insert email address] within [insert number] days of receiving your purchase. We'll provide you with a return authorization number and a shipping label. Once we receive your item, we will send you the new item.

Please note that we cannot guarantee that the size or color you want will be in stock at the time of your exchange. In this case, we will issue you a refund for the item.
